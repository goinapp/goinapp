## What Is In-App Purchasing?

In-app purchasing refers to the buying of goods and services from inside an application on a device, such as a smartphone or tablet. 
In-app purchases allow developers to provide their application for free. 
The developer then advertises upgrades to the paid version, paid feature unlocks, special items for sale, or even ads other apps and services to anyone who downloads the free version. 
This allows the developer to profit despite giving the basic app itself away for free.

### Supported Platforms

 - IOS 
 - Android - coming soon!
